# Pagination Pattern

The pagination allows you to get a subset of sorted data in a comprehensible form. Moreover,
design pattern is widely used in websites that open up a lot of content to users. From search
engines such as Google and Firefox, to e-commerce sites such as Amazon and Asos—the use of
pagination is very, very broad.

### Usage
- Use when it is unsuitable to display all the data on a single page/screen.
- Use when the dataset is in some way ordered.
- Do not use when you don’t want the user to pause for navigating to the next page.


<div className="tip-wrapper">
  <span className="tip">Remember</span>
  Structure and hierarchy reduce complexity and improve readability.
  The more organized your items are, the easier it is for users to follow.
